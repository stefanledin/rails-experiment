## Pendlarkollen  
"Pendlarkollen" is an application I've built in Ruby On Rails. The main purpose was to build a slightly more complex app in the framework than I've done before in order to learn it.  
The result is an app where you can add "trips", maybe if you commute to work like I do, and see how many minutes late you are each day thanks to the train or bus.  
The user does not need to create a account, he or she can log in with Facebook (using the Koala-gem) and start to add trips.  
There is still a lot of things to do with the app like adding validation and stuff like that. But as long it's just a personal project, I don't think I'll be spending time at fixing minor bugs of that nature.
